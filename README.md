# Apple Automation
A collection of scripts and whatever used for Automation on the Mac

I have a bunch of AppleScripts and Shortcuts that I use for automating simple things on my Mac and making life easier.  There are a bunch of podcasts that are excellent that also have scripts for Keyboard Maestro, Hazel, AppleScript, Shortcuts and what not, but there aren't a lot of repositories that have these kinds of thinds, nor are they available.

So I thought I'd create a respository people can contribute to if they want.

I will create a seperate folder for things to try to keep things organized.  If people want to contribute to it, knock yourself out.  I encourage the sharing of this type of information, and don't know why people hold it for ransom.

About: This script allows you select a meeting from your calendar (By default it looks in all calendars), it pulls the name, and time of the meeting, the Attendees, and the "Notes" (or Agenda of the meeting), and creates a Note in `Notes.app` in the "Meetings" folder with all that information.  It then uses the "pin" command in the shortcuts app to pin the meeting to the top of your Notes list.

Why: Pretty obvious I think.

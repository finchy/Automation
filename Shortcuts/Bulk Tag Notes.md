Bulk Tag Notes.md

About:  I stole this from someone online, don't know where, sorry I didn't credit you, will gladly do so in the shortcut if you contact me.  That being said, this asks "What do you want to search for", and then asks what tag you want to apply, then will go through your Notes in `Notes.app` and apply that tag for context.

Why:  I like to use this to tag /people/ and /places/ and /subjects/ or /companies/ so I can easily sort my Notes by tag to reference things easily.

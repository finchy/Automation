About: Creates a Daily record of everything you've done that day to keep track of life in a folder called "Journal" in `Notes.app`.  Weather for the day, tasks completed (from Reminders), any calendar events for that day, as well as any Notes in Notes.app created that day.  Then it leaves an area for you to jot down your ideas and thoughts and any general notes for the day.

Why:  I have found it useful to keep track of when things are done, what meetings you had and what was said.  I also use `Hook.app` to link Notes together and things like that.
